# SmartHome

This is the eKalyptus Smart Home Project. The Project consists of three Components:
- [The Base](https://github.com/k0a1adev/SmartHome-Base) that controls everything
- [The Slave](https://github.com/k0a1adev/SmartHome-Slave) that takes signals from the Base and executes actions
- [The Web Application](https://github.com/k0a1adev/SmartHome-Web) that makes the whole System controllable over the Network

###Hardware
The Base of the whole System is a simple Raspberry Pi that is connected to your local Network using Lan or WiFi. The Slaves are all Arduinos that are connected to the Raspberry Pi over the Serial Port or Wireless. The Web Application runs on the Base of the System.
